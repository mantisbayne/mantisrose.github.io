<p>Meredith was born in Bakersfield, CA, but spent most of her early childhood in Farmington, NM.   Her childhood was heavily influenced by the unique culture of rural New Mexico, living near the Navajo reservation and being very inspired by their way of life.

<p>Her dad was laid off from his geophysicist job in the oil industry, so the Bayne family moved back to Bakersfield.   Meredith struggled to fit in to the conservative culture there, so she worked hard in high school to be accepted to the school she though embodied the polar opposite of Bakersfield -- Berkeley.
</p>

<p>Once at Berkeley, she fell immediately into the drug culture and became notoriously known as a 'party girl'.  Then, she moved into the Berkeley Student Cooperative, starting with the now-notorious Cloyne Court co-op.   After three years of insane partying, she was kicked out.</p>

<p>She moved to San Francisco, where she continued a 'party' lifestyle.  She worked for a high-profile tech company in order to afford the high rent in the Bernal Heights neighborhood.  While living there, she toyed with a polyamorous, queer lifestyle and frequented any bar within stumbling distance of her room.  After her one-year contract with the tech company ended, she decided to move to Denver to live with her mom and try to live clean.  This struggle proved much more difficult than she planned.</p>

<p>In early 2012, she received a call from the high-profile tech company asking her to return to work.  They gave her the option to work out of the Bay Area or out of Austin, TX.  Wanting to avoid the drugged out lifestyle she had in SF, she chose to work in Austin.</p>

<p>Austin became the city where Meredith's life would become better than she could possibly imagine.  However, it also became a city where she would suffer great loss.  She discovered coding, which gave her personal and professional life purpose.   She struggled to maintain sobriety, but finally found a group of people to support her efforts to stay clean.</p>
