Because of the tragic overdose that left John Gibson (who I knew as 'Candy John' because of his raver kid persona) braindead, Cloyne Court co-op in Berkeley is closing, removing all residents, and re-opening as a 'substance-free' dorm.   

This event made me reflect on my time there, which was filled with pills and powders, glitter, spandex, bottle-breaking, nudity, public urination, and just general insanity.  When I first moved in, it was summer, which was a little tame.   However, no one blinked an eye when I screamed "Let's buy hella blow and then break shit!".   I did my hallway cleaning workshift naked every time to get double the hours.   I streaked through house meetings.   My friend Katie and I wandered the streets in full BDSM gear, with me guiding her on a leash.   We took molly and then just lay in our friend's tempur pedic mattress for hours butt-naked, drinking Wyder's Pear Cider and doing Whip-Its.

I moved down the street to Casa Zimbabwe for a semester, but I missed Cloyne so much that I had to move back.   On my move in day, I got all of my stuff moved for me in under an hour, because I just went to to common room and yelled "Anyone who helps me move a box gets a beer and a line!"

We did do a lot of drugs, for sure, but we also were constantly in each other's lives.   I struggled with health problems throughout college, and, because I lived at Cloyne, I could always rely on getting a ride to the doctor or somebody to cheer me up while I waited for test results or a prescription.   I made friends that I could rely on, who were always there for me.   Actually, some of them still are in my life.

My personal drug use did escalate over the years that I lived in the co-ops.   I would take any pill or drink any liquid handed my way, without questioning.  I have a lot of memories of just being in a haze, screaming, breaking bottles, stumbling into walls.   My friends and I would play this game called 'whiskey slap'.   To play, you would take a shot of whiskey (usually actually a swig straight from the handle), and then your friend would slap you in the face.  We would get kicked out of bars for going and ordering our own pitchers of beer and trying to drink straight out of them (illegal in California).  Things weren't so silly and innocent anymore.   Many of us developed full-fledged addictions (I am included in this group).

I know Gibson was the same way.   I remember watching him DJ during a party while doing Whip-Its.   Of course, I didn't think anything of it, because I was getting just as fucked up all the time.

When Gibson overdosed and we heard the news that he would be permanently brain damaged, the reaction was generally denial.   "How could he have OD'd just on coke and ketamine?"  "There MUST be something else at play."  "We all do that many drugs all the time, and we're fine."  "I heard he also took Valium" "I heard he also took opiates".  We just couldn't understand it.

I wish I could say that incident inspired us to clean up our act, but it did not.   Shortly thereafter, I was kicked out of the Berkeley Student Cooperative for drunk and destructive behavior.   When I moved out, it was a shock adjusting to the outside world.   As the months and then years passed, Cloyne seemed more like this weird place very far away.   The things I did there did not seem real.   Cloyne will be lodged in my memory as this strange limbo I was in for a few years.   

Despite the insanity, I made friends at Cloyne that I'll have for life, I hope.
