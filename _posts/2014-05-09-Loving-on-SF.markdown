A lot of my friends have been sharing articles that hate on San Francisco hardcore lately.  Although I agree with some of the points in these articles (tech people are driving up rents and overcrowding the city, the 'vibe' of the city is different now), I think that there may be some overreaction.  Granted, it has been some years since I lived there, and I was only technically in the city of SF for one year, but I did have a lot of fun when I lived there and love the city. 

When I visited again last October, I had a great time, and it brought back so many crazy memories.

My first apartment was right in the heart of the Mission, at 24th and Alabama.   The Mission was a pretty hip neighborhood at that time, but now I think it has become very expensive the the gentrification is intense.  It's a colorful neighborhood with lots of street art, bars, art galleries, shops, and really great restaurants.  The Mexican food is amazing.  I liked the area, but my first living situation ended up being a nightmare.

Without telling me, the girl who was renting the room to me filled the other room with this creepy, 40-year-old, cokehead alcoholic guy with two disgustingly overweight cats.   One of cats was so fat and lumpy that I would feel like vomiting when I saw her.   His room smelled terrible.  I would often come home to him drinking 211 Steel Reserve tall cans and blowing lines on a plate in the kitchen or some other surface.  Then, he would somehow fail to pay rent.  Ummm maybe cool it on the coke for a month, bro?

The apartment got infested with fleas and there was a pigeon problem.  I asked the landlord to fix things, and he texted my roommate that he wanted to strangle me.  He also would text my roommate (who was 21 years old) things like 'I just saw you get out of that shower and it was beautiful'.  Creep.

After that, I moved to the north slope of Bernal Heights, which was just within stumbling distance of my favorite bars in the Mission, so I loved it.  I could easily ride my bike to Dolores Park, where I would waste many days just getting shitfaced in the sun.

I loved to get Bi-Rite soft-serve ice cream or lollipops and eat them in the park.

All I cared about when I lived there was partying, and SF definitely provided plenty of resources for doing that.   One resource that I frequented was the Phone Booth, which was a bar notorious for pouring extremely strong (and also CHEAP) drinks.   I wasted a lot of nights there, because I could get wasted off of only two drinks.   (I think every time I dared to have three drinks, I literally BLACKED OUT)

I had a lot of interesting casual relationships, including polyamorous and queer ones.   I remember really loving my friends, and it was never weird that I had sex with them.   Like, most of them... sometimes more than one of them at a time.   SF is relatively queer-friendly (but not as much as one would think... my roommate once complained that she felt uncomfortable when she came home to see my male friend wearing one of my dresses).   Many of my friends were beautiful and really had unique style.   People in SF know how to dress.

In addition to having beautiful people who have unique style, SF itself is beautiful.  As long as you don't look too closely or inhale the urine smell too strongly, you can see a lot of beauty.  Sometimes, I'm a little bummed that things got so dark there that I felt forced to move away, but I'll have to reflect on that another time.
