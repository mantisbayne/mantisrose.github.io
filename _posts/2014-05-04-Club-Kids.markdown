Dear Michael Alig,

Please invite me to party with you.  I have read and watched 'Party Monster' countless times.  I've watched YouTube videos of you on talk shows in full club kid gear.  I've dreamed of you and James St James.  I even went through a phase of heavily using Special K in your honor.  Contact me.  THANKS!
