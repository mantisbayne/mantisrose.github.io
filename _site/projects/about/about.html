			<p>Meredith was born in Bakersfield, CA, but grew up in New Mexico, where she skied, climbed juniper trees, and roller-bladed like a maniac (it was the 90s).  After high school, she moved to Berkeley to <em>learn</em> about life.  While living in the Bay Area, she got lots of living-room tatttoos and went on adventures.  Through a strange series of events, she ended up in Denver and, finally, Austin, where she experiments in bad-ass-ery every day.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>She met Muhammad Ali at the Albuquerque Airport</li>
					<li>This SXSW, she got to ask Neil DeGrasse Tyson a question about the shape of the universe during a conference about Cosmos</li>
					<li>She's a really good skier, because she's skied all her life all over Colorado, New Mexico, and California</li>
